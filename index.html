Having studied GIS (Geographic Information Systems), political science and urban affairs, my expertise is in using ESRI ArcGIS to turn demographic and locational databases into maps and reports.<br><br>After graduating in 2011, my history of volunteering for local non-profits led me to work on a number of advocacy campaigns using grassroots organizing and social media outreach to build mass audiences. My work has been featured on PBS, in the New York Times and Washington Post, and most recently, The Guardian.<br><br>In my free time, I enjoy drawing, cartooning and crafting - but while I was in school, I never had the chance to see how I could build on my visual and artistic skills and apply them to my career.

I'm excited to be returning to the world of tech and learning more about web development, UI/UX and product design.<br><br>
