<!doctype html><html><head><title>Startups ♥ NY: Alternate visualizations of NYC's startup community.</title><h1><font face="Helvetica, Arial"><font size="48">Startups <big><font color="red">♥</font></big> NY<br></h1></font size><h3>New Yorkers need jobs.<br>Startups need talent.<br>Let's make some matches.</h3><p>Right now, <a href="http://www.mappedinny.com">Mapped in NY</a> displays the locations of startups and other tech companies throughout the five boroughs. You can check out the locations of coworking spaces, find investors, and most importantly, determine who's hiring. It's a killer display of the strength and prevalence of our tech industry - but for job seekers looking to differentiate between the next Google and the next Pets.com, it's lacking in details.<br><br>My goal is to build an interactive app that will allow startup job seekers to uncover vital information and make better informed decisions about where to apply.<br></p><h1>What do startup job seekers want to see?</h1><ul><li><h3>The number of jobs open at each company.</h3>It's not just a matter of who's hiring - we want to see where the most opportunities are, and who's building teams.<li><h3>The number of employees currently working at each company.</h3><li><h3>How much funding has been raised by each company, and where it came from.</h3><li><h3>Spatial trends for all of the above.</ul></p><h1>Limitations:</h1><ul><li><h3>Current skills</h3>I'm certified in Geographic Information Systems, but most of my knowledge is in creating static, not interactive maps. I've tried teaching myself how to import data from APIs (such as the <a href="https://angel.co/api/spec/jobs#GET_jobs">AngelList GetJobs API</a>, which would be extremely helpful) but cannot figure out how to join the data to the CSV files I have for business names and locations. However, I'm confident that I'll learn how to do this with the guidance of the Startup Institute.<li><h3>Platform power</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.esri.com"><b>ESRI ArcGIS</b></a> is the gold standard of mapping platforms, but it's best in its desktop form and becomes costly and difficult to use as a web app.</li><br><li><a href="http://www.cartodb.com"><b>CartoDB</b></a> is the next big thing and contains a multitude of options for spatial analysis and temporal views. However, I do not know how to import API data through CartoDB, and you can only geocode 100 addresses with a free account - meanwhile, there are nearly 2,000 startups listed in the Mapped in NY database!<br><br><li><a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables"><b>Google Fusion Tables</b></a> is the easiest new platform and can turn CSVs from Google Spreadsheets into Google Maps layers within minutes. By geocoding 1000 addresses free of charge, Google Fusion Tables can display a better representative slice of the NYC startup scene<br><br>I created two Fusion Tables using Mapped in NY data: <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1EHrziowBiyGULgCCmyN62RcKEMnsi5qtuRP818bz">a heat map of all of the businesses listed as "Hiring" as of September 2014</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=18pFfwW87Twl136wyHymT_7ET_Bxhba3zHcrzsDV3">an inverse version showing businesses that are not hiring.</a><br><br>Unfortunately, Google does not allow heat maps containing geocoded addresses to be published elsewhere - otherwise, I'd have embedded them here.</ul><li><h3>Availability of data</h3>NYC's open data repository, which powers Mapped in NY, displays the names, URLs, social media links and hiring status for each startup listed. Company size and amount of capital raised are not available. <a href="https://developer.crunchbase.com/docs">Crunchbase</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/api/spec/jobs">AngelList</a> both provide a wealth of data about startups and funding, but I will need to learn how to import information from APIs before I'm able to use either.<br><br>Aside from what these sites offer, the amount of venture capital raised is typically privately held data or would required a specialized data scraper to scrub databases that require special or costly access (i.e. <a href="http://www.dowjones.com/privateequityventurecapital/venturesource.asp">Dow Jones Venture Source</a>).</ul><h1>So can this map be done?</h1><p><b>Yes!</b> Once I learn more about how to create web apps and import crucial API data using jQuery, I'm sure that I'll be able to bootstrap a fully functional map on my own using my platform of choice. I'm determined.<br><br> Ideally, the map will have switches to toggle different categories on and off, and display spatial trends over time - for example, where have the jobs been booming in 2014? Where have they been drying up? Where are the highest maximum salaries, and where are the lowest minimum? There are so many relevant questions to NYC's startup job seekers, and I'm determined to answer them. With the help of the Startup Institute (and their phenomenal staff), I will.</p></body><br><footer><small><sub>Updated October 12th, 2014.</sub></small></footer></html>
